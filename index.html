    *not defined : any variable which we try to acess not declared throw a error as not defined
    *undefined : if variable is declared but not assigned a value , but we try to acess that variable then will get error as undefined.
    *value= null , means that variale can be declared at any time after the line.
                
    hoisting : its oly supported with var keywords and with the functions.  let and const keywords dont support hoisting.

    let keyword cannot acessed before declaraton or intialization.


    note : for var keyword variables if we try to acess them before acess assigning values to the will give us undefined but the moment we declare a value to it , it will give as assigned value.


    Hoisting in functions : it supports with variable keywords and with function.   let and const keywords donT support hoisting.


    operators : 1. arithmetic  2.comparison  3.logical  4.increment decrement  
    
    
    arithmetic operators : add,sub, divide, multiply,modulus.

    comparison operators :  < , > , <= ,>= ,== , === . (It gives only boolean values true/False).

    logical operators : ll , && , !.

    increment decrement operators : ++ , --  value is seen on next line.  console.log(a++);//1//i will first print the value of a, and then increment its value with 1 which will be reflected/shown in next line,not on the same line
